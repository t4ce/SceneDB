//! A plain, row-count-agnostic growable SSBO — no `ComponentId`, no
//! `Entity`, no dirty-tracking, no region/cell concept. For pipeline-owned
//! GPU data whose length is decided by a compute pass each frame
//! (visibility lists, compacted indices, indirect draw args) rather than by
//! `World`'s entity count — see the "GPU-native fields on World entities"
//! README section for the full boundary this type exists to formalize:
//! that class of data is explicitly **not** what `#[gpu]` component fields
//! (`gpu::world_mirror`) are for, and previously had no supported home in
//! this crate at all, forcing every consumer to hand-roll their own growable
//! buffer (e.g. Helio's own `GrowableBuffer<T>`, built with no relationship
//! to this crate).
//!
//! A separate, `ComponentId`-addressable growable column type for
//! World-mirrored `#[gpu]` fields (tracked upstream) is expected to share
//! this type's grow-and-copy mechanics rather than reimplementing them — the
//! two differ only in whether they're reachable through `SceneGpuStore` by
//! type, not in how they grow.
