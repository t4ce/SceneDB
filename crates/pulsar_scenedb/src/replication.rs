//! # SceneDB Replication Primitives
//!
//! SceneDB is the natural home for replication primitives because it already
//! owns the authoritative state of every scene in the engine — entities,
//! components, spatial cells, liveness, handles, generations, and the frame
//! phase machine. Replication is not a bolt-on service; it is the data layer
//! exposing a controlled, observable, and filterable stream of its own
//! mutations.
//!
//! ## Design tenets
//!
//! 1. **SceneDB owns the data pipeline** — change tracking, delta encoding,
//!    interest management, authority, and condition filtering. Everything up
//!    to encoded byte blobs.
//! 2. **SceneDB does NOT own transport** — networking, encryption, connection
//!    management, and asset streaming live in the engine. SceneDB produces
//!    `Delta` frames and `ReplicatedEvent` payloads; the engine ships them.
//! 3. **SceneDB does NOT own asset payloads** — a `gpu_handle`-mode field
//!    replicates only the handle index (8 bytes), not the vertex data. The
//!    asset system (`engine-fs`, streaming, etc.) independently ensures the
//!    resource exists on the remote peer.
//! 4. **SceneDB does NOT own editor collaboration** — operational transform,
//!    lock servers, undo history, and CRDTs live in the editor. SceneDB
//!    provides `Shared` ownership + deterministic frame-batched conflict
//!    resolution; the editor builds collaboration semantics on top.
//! 5. **Endianness is a non-concern** — every target platform (x86-64, ARM64,
//!    ARM64EC, WebAssembly) is little-endian. The build asserts
//!    `cfg!(target_endian = "little")` and fails fast otherwise.
//!
//! ## Two orthogonal axes
//!
//! Every replicated field declares:
//!
//! - A [`ReplicationEncoding`] — *how* the data is encoded on the wire
//! - A [`ReplicationCondition`] — *who* receives it and *who* owns it
//!
//! ## ReplicationEncoding
//!
//! | Variant | Wire cost | When to use |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `Pod` | `sizeof(T)` bytes, direct memcpy | Simple value types — transforms, stats, enums. Default for anything implementing `Pod`. Schema negotiated once at handshake. |
//! | `Serialized` | Variable | Reflection-based via `EngineClass`. For blueprint/visual-scripting components. |
//! | `GpuHandle` | `sizeof(Handle)` = 8 B | Mesh references, texture handles, buffer bindings. Only the registry index travels; the GPU resource is loaded independently by the asset system. |
//! | `DeltaCompressed` | Small, variable | Slowly-changing values (health, cooldown, ammo). XOR-diff from the last acknowledged value, then LEB128 encoded — the stateful [`DeltaCompressor`] implements this; the standalone [`encode_field_value`]/[`decode_field_value`] helpers only do the stateless LEB128-of-the-absolute-value half (no cache to diff against). |
//! | `Event` | 0 in state deltas | One-shot RPC-style delivery. Never appears in frame snapshots or reconciliation state. Delivered on a separate channel. |
//! | `Opaque` | Custom | Escape hatch. The component provides `encode`/`decode` fn pointers at registration time. |
//!
//! ## ReplicationCondition
//!
//! Replication conditions jointly control two things:
//!
//! - **Visibility** — which clients receive this field's value in deltas
//! - **Authority** — which peer is allowed to write it
//!
//! | Condition | Visibility | Authority | Unreal equivalent |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | `Always` | All clients | Server | `COND_None` |
//! | `OwnerOnly` | Owning client only | Server | `COND_OwnerOnly` |
//! | `SkipOwner` | All except owner | Server | `COND_SkipOwner` |
//! | `SimulatedOnly` | Non-owning clients only | Server | `COND_SimulatedOnly` |
//! | `AutonomousOnly` | Owning client only | Server | `COND_AutonomousOnly` |
//! | `InitialOnly` | Once, at spawn | Server | `COND_InitialOnly` |
//! | `ServerAuthority` | All clients | **Server** | default server-replicated |
//! | `ClientAuthority` | All clients | **Owning client** | client-replicated movement |
//! | `ServerToClient` | One specific client | Server | `Client` RPC direction |
//! | `ClientToServer` | Server only | Owning client | `Server` RPC direction |
//! | `Multicast` | All except sender | Anyone | `NetMulticast` RPC |
//!
//! `ServerAuthority` is the default for state fields. `ClientAuthority` is
//! used for fields the owning client controls (character movement input,
//! camera look) — the server still validates bounds and rejects violations.
//!
//! ## Events (RPCs)
//!
//! Fields declared with `encoding = ReplicationEncoding::Event` are **not**
//! state. They are one-shot invocations with typed arguments, delivered
//! on a separate reliable-or-unreliable channel:
//!
//! The `ReplicationCondition` on an event field determines direction:
//!
//! | Condition | Direction |
//! |---|---|
//! | `ClientToServer` | Client fires → server receives (Unreal "Server" RPC) |
//! | `ServerToClient` | Server fires → one client receives (Unreal "Client" RPC) |
//! | `Multicast` | Anyone fires → everyone else receives (Unreal "NetMulticast") |
//!
//! Events are queued on the `ChangeTracker` as they fire and flushed once
//! per frame. Reliability is declared on the field, not negotiated per-call.
//!
//! ## Schema registration
//!
//! ```ignore
//! registry.register::<MeshRenderer>()
//!     .field("mesh",            |c| &c.mesh,            |c| &mut c.mesh,            ReplicationEncoding::GpuHandle,   ReplicationCondition::Always)
//!     .field("local_transform", |c| &c.local_transform, |c| &mut c.local_transform, ReplicationEncoding::Pod,         ReplicationCondition::ServerAuthority)
//!     .field("health",          |c| &c.health,          |c| &mut c.health,          ReplicationEncoding::DeltaCompressed, ReplicationCondition::SimulatedOnly)
//!     .event("on_hit",          ReplicationCondition::Multicast,  EventChannel::Unreliable);
//! ```
//!
//! `#[derive(Replicate)]` generates exactly this shape from
//! `#[replicate(...)]` field attributes — see that macro's doc.
//!
//! The registry produces a `ReplicationSchema` — a compact per-component-type
//! descriptor table that the delta encoder walks at runtime. The schema is
//! also shared with remote peers during the initial connection handshake so
//! both sides agree on field layout and encoding.
//!
//! ## Authority model
//!
//! - `Server` is the default. Server authority + client prediction via the
//!   `Reconciler`.
//! - `Client(ClientId)` gives a specific client write permission. Server
//!   still receives the delta, validates bounds, and re-broadcasts.
//! - `Shared` is for multi-user editor sessions. Both peers can write the
//!   same field in the same frame. At the frame boundary, conflicts are
//!   resolved deterministically: the peer with the higher `ClientId` wins.
//!   No locks, no operational transform — optimistic apply with frame-level
//!   rollback.
//!
//! ## The delta pipeline
//!
//! Every frame, at the **SimulateB→Harvest** phase boundary:
//!
//! ```text
//! 1. ChangeTracker.drain()
//!      ↓
//! 2. For each connected client:
//!      a. RelevanceSet.filter(delta, client)
//!           - spatial filter (SpatialCell::query_aabb_in)
//!           - condition filter (ReplicationCondition per field)
//!      b. Encode filtered fields via ReplicationEncoding
//!      c. Append events from the event queue
//!      ↓
//! 3. Emit Delta (state) + EventBatch (RPCs)
//!      ↓
//! 4. Engine transports to remote peer
//! ```
//!
//! Step 2a reuses the existing SIMD-accelerated `SpatialCell::query_aabb_in`
//! with `LivenessSnapshot` — zero allocation, zero serialization for
//! out-of-relevance entities.
//!
//! ## Where SceneDB stops
//!
//! ```text
//! SceneDB owns:
//!   ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
//!   │ ChangeTracker → Delta/EventBatch                 │
//!   │ RelevanceSet  → per-connection filter            │
//!   │ AuthorityTable → condition + conflict resolution │
//!   │ ReplicationSchema → encoding dispatch            │
//!   │ Reconciler → client prediction + rollback        │
//!   └──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
//!
//! NOT SceneDB:
//!   - Network transport (TCP, UDP, WebSocket, Steam, EOS, etc.)
//!   - Encryption, authentication, anti-cheat
//!   - Asset streaming (mesh/texture/sound payloads)
//!   - Editor OT/CRDT, lock server, undo history
//!   - Connection lifecycle, NAT punch, relay
//! ```
//!
//! ## Concurrency model
//!
//! `ReplicationRegistry`, `Delta`, `ChangeTracker`, `AuthorityTable`, and
//! `RelevanceSet` are all `Send + Sync` (asserted at compile time below) —
//! a `Delta` produced on a simulation thread can be hand off through a
//! channel to a network thread, and a `ReplicationRegistry` built once at
//! startup can be shared read-only (`&ReplicationRegistry`) across threads
//! that each encode/apply their own `Delta`s against their own `World`.
//!
//! What this module does **not** provide is safe *concurrent mutation* of
//! one `ChangeTracker`/`World` from multiple threads — `ChangeTracker`'s
//! `record_*` methods and `World`'s tracked mutators take `&mut self`, and
//! there is no internal locking. The intended shape (matching
//! `crate::gpu::phase`'s own single-threaded-caller design) is: one thread
//! owns a `World` + `ChangeTracker` pair for the duration of a frame; the
//! `Delta` that frame produces is the unit that crosses thread/connection
//! boundaries, not the mutable state itself.
//!
//! ## Implementation plan
//!
//! ### R1 — Core types and ChangeTracker
//!
//! - Define `ReplicationEncoding`, `ReplicationCondition`, `EventChannel`,
//!   `ClientId`, `Ownership`, `ReplicatedEvent`.
//! - Implement `ChangeTracker` with hooks for `spawn`, `despawn`,
//!   `insert`, `remove`, `set` on `World`.
//! - Wire `World` methods to accept `&mut ChangeTracker`.
//! - Unit tests verifying correct change accumulation across a frame.
//!
//! ### R2 — Schema and delta encoding
//!
//! - Define `ReplicationSchema` and `ReplicationRegistry`.
//! - Derive macro `#[replicate(...)]` for component fields.
//! - Implement `Delta` struct + encoding for all built-in
//!   `ReplicationEncoding` variants (Pod is a direct memcpy, etc.).
//! - Schema handshake message for connection initialization.
//! - Unit tests: round-trip encode/decode for every encoding mode.
//!
//! ### R3 — Relevance and conditions
//!
//! - Implement `RelevanceSet` with spatial filter
//!   (delegates to `SpatialCell::query_aabb_in`).
//! - Implement condition filter (owner check, simulated/autonomous check).
//! - Implement `AuthorityTable` with conflict detection at frame boundary.
//! - Integration test: 10,000 entities, 4 simulated clients, verify each
//!   receives only its relevant subset.
//!
//! ### R4 — Event channel
//!
//! - Wire event fields through `ChangeTracker` with a dedicated event queue.
//! - Define `EventBatch` message (separate from `Delta`).
//! - Implement direction enforcement (Client→Server, Server→Client, Multicast).
//! - Unit tests: event delivery ordering, reliability modes, dropped-event
//!   detection.
//!
//! ### R5 — Snapshot and reconciliation
//!
//! - Implement `Snapshot` (full/partial world state at a frame).
//! - Implement `Reconciler` with history ring buffer + pending input replay.
//! - Support `Shared` ownership with deterministic conflict resolution.
//! - Integration test: client-side prediction with server correction,
//!   verify rollback converges within 3 frames.

// coherence must conservatively consider downstream implementations even
// though SceneDB's strengthened `Pod: bytemuck::Pod` contract (and therefore
// `Copy`) makes a sound Box implementation impossible in practice. If you
// need a boxed field, implement `Replicable` directly for your concrete `Box<YourType>`
// (a single non-blanket impl, which does not hit this rule) — it's just

/// `DeltaCompressed` update will desync the two caches and corrupt every
/// subsequent value for that slot until [`Self::acknowledge`] or
/// [`Self::forget`] re-synchronizes them (e.g. after applying a full
/// [`Snapshot`] resync). This is exactly why the module doc frames the
